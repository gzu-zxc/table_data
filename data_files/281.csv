Indications are better, cues from foreign market important. Rahu is always deceptive, especially when is active with Ketu, so, trade cautiously. Certain countries may try to pump funds in their own open market, which may give advantage to their market, but we must be watchful for our internal situation also.Virus and related issues may remain active and globally situation may show some further fear. In our nation also, chances have developed, because of movements and casual approach by patients and others also.It will be better to minimize carry-forward for long position, because of some steps can be decided after our closing hour or I can say that foreign cues will be more important for tomorrow's market.Rahu may not allow to form base in the market in short period (I wish this observation goes wrong.) Krishna Paksha of Chaitra month of Hindu calendar – Panchami (fifth date of fortnight) is Kshay and Dwadashi (Twelfth day of fortnight) is Adhitithi.

Foreign cues, health issues + local issues (<strong>sone pe suhaga</strong>) like unemployment, falling GDP, falling Production from last one or more than one year.Weekend ahead.I mean to say that we may fall more than global falling (this will not surprise me), Rahu in finance and banks has shown its game. Reactive policies may not go to solve the issue, only properly planned and then execution will give a positive indication to the market. Within last one year – Finance was on the basis to boost share market (reactive) but not for the concrete growth and for employment (which was clearly seen after November 8<sup>th</sup>, 2016).Corona virus is clear. Only research or out of the box solution may give some relief from the virus. Announcements from government for closing cinema hall or schools (state wise) is indicating alarming conditions. Countries like US, Germany or Ministers in the European nations, are facing negative impact of Corona. Research work result is still awaited.Again, crude is falling, Currency may lose its level. Protect your funds, because this can be again a fall for all the segments, because all the planets are active directly or indirectly. Chances of change in movements after 14:00 Hrs (IST) is possible (just a chance).Better to wait and watch for the movements. Protect your funds.

This may give chance to sail in the current of the flow of market. Even then I am afraid of bit volatility after some time of opening. Foreign cues are important, but at the same time local conditions are more important.Ketu will gain strength, indicating that virus impact may increase in coming period. Globally, situation may be bit more tough. In India we must take more precautions.Although previous day we had seen great fall and then remarkable recovery from lower levels. Global markets are indicating for 10 years yield (Like Germany, France and many more). We have yielded 7 year. It will be interesting to see proceedings during the day, because again wave like sea can be seen in either side (direction wise). Confidence in the market (according to the planetary position) is missing. Previous day, I had suggested to protect your funds. Only long-term investors can look for only very strong companies at lower rates but stage wise, to get the proper levels of their equities, I mean to get the average better.Intraday traders can use their intellect and go with very strict stop-loss. Global cues will be important along with the Gold and Crude oil levels. I feel market may look to form a base.Waves will not be a surprise. Look for Opportunities on both sides.Maximum segments will be playing their roles. Only point is good equities will be showing better movements during this condition.

This is rare event.Market is facing Utha-patak, secondly Rahu and Ketu are also playing for Volatility. From 22-03-2020, Mars and Saturn will be in the same sign, so this Pandemic (Corona Virus) or some other natural calamity may hit Universe. Previously on many occasions this combination has given Plague and other Pandemic (inclusive in developed nations like US etc.). So, till 30-03-2020 situation may be bit tough after that for few days Jupiter will enter in Capricorn (30-03-2020), so that may be period of little relief (possibly).Still, I feel that movements from lower levels can be seen, (smart people's move). Global cues from western world is not decent.Many segments are active, so whatever movements will be seen – will be for many segments. Banks due to certain banks may show movements.Nifty may try to show some recovery, but I am not confident for long as on date.Trade wisely during this period.

Apart from astrology, practically – Anti Virus medicine may take a year or so, from the time of break out of virus.Anyways, todays position may be seen with some neutral movements or we may see some buying at lower levels. Trouble is India VIX.We must watch foreign cues also. Reasons are that our own weaknesses. Telecom and related banks may show sudden movements, may be based on Judiciary decisions. Possibility of movements in automobile little bit (may be due to availability of equities at very attractive rates and some other news).Crude is losing its levels, so oil exploring companies may be showing pressure, whereas oil marketing companies may be bit better, although demands in the market is not encouraging.

This Saturn in Capricorn sign is strong in own sign, but disturbed due to the conjunction of exalted Mars, heading for planetary war. Indications are that due to foreign issues, we may be bit disturbed in coming period, but after 4 days, we may be bit better, because lord of karma and fortune. Jupiter will be moving in with Saturn and Mars. Possibly this may give some better indications for public or nation. Still, time to be careful about health-related issues and take proper precautions.During the year (Samvat 2077), it may be good for giant businesspersons and weak for the small one. Traders in share market must trade with care.For the day, Volatility is possible. Market is moving on the basis of news and possibly, some people may be trying to avail best of gains from previous fall. I would like to be watchful, wait for the Pandemic impacts on US in coming period. Also, India's Lockdown stage. Income of common man is blocked. They are feeling insecure, how could market justify consumption of 80% of business. Only edibles can show movements with healthcare segments.Our IT is based on foreign markets, they are in bad shape, in such conditions, how could we respond in a better way. Only after this control on Pandemic, we may get advantage on many areas.Planetary movement wise, situation is indicting bit volatility (Possible), see the direction of the trade and move accordingly. Only hardcore traders should play. Casual traders should trade with strong care. Unpredictable situation, Rahu and Ketu with enemy Sun are holding main key. Chances of volatility (market has rolled back from the 6 years low – for a while, this is important, but this can be a trap also). We should not compare our country's liquidity with US or Europe etc. India corp. must be expecting relief from our government also. Are we in such position or at par position, our GDP was in declining mode since past few years.Selling on upper levels not surprising. But Volatility is possible.

It is fact that results of various companies will be weak, which will not be only because of Corona, but impact of previous one year (weak) or we can say poor economic growth of nation during last 2 years and above all COVID. Unemployment is/will be another key factor for the market in coming period after Lockdown phase.Everyone is trying to take money from common man in the name of COVID, without providing proper services. Even government has curtailed finances of Central government employees, impact will be for some other states which are following blindly centre. Private sectors are waiting to cut wages, salaries, retrench employees – which may give further very big impact on consumption story of the market in coming months. So, long term investments – wait for a while. Banks are also enjoying advantage to improve their mismanaged NPAs, RBI's support and relief is not passed on to common man (home loan etc), rather deducted Interest rates on savings and FDs etc.I had mentioned in my post related to the transit of Saturn in Capricorn that this Saturn will do justice with everyone, the way we got this national management, Saturn is giving Justice accordingly, one can derive meaning of the same.For the day, market may show some selling on the upper levels. Nifty may try to test lower levels also. Market may look for news from Government or government agencies (which will be for traders/intraday traders basis).Six planets are directly active and indirectly all the planets are active, so whatever movement we will see (direction wise) may be strong (either side).I would like to avoid carrying position for Monday. Wait and watch at the time of opening of market, let the market set for the direction.

Few companies have diverted their productions towards medical equipment according to the need of the hour.For long term investors, it is not possible to go for total investments, but impacts of lockdown are unpredictable, so can not advice for the long term investments, possibly they may miss their chances, but it is better to earn less than the losing of money.China is still trying to regularize situation in Wuhan area.We are hoping for investments from various (huge number of companies) after this lockdown phase, but point is – our infrastructure and political system (opposition and some other organizations). I am sure this time everyone will be thinking in the benefit of nation.Crude and currency are under pressure. Trade to enjoy advantage of the situation for the day, stop-loss essential. Trading for Nifty may be in the range of 9300 to 9000 levels. I am not hopeful for banking for the day.

They are not getting any support from government or anyone, but may face financial crunch, unemployment, and other issues. Directly or indirectly rates of every commodity is increased for consumer. Taxes are increased + their fixed expenses in this reduced income or after losing of income will be tough for consumers.

But still, better to trade with strict stop-loss.Crude may be improving due to retrograde of related planet (this may continue till August).News related to Pandemic or Virus may be bit better (possibility of some positive indications for treatment/Vaccine/medicine etc.).Volatility in the running period will not be surprising (coming period). I am still watchful for Banks for the coming period.Many segments may be showing movements. That may include infrastructure, power, automobile ancillary, spirit, movements in banks also, with insurance, research or laboratories and petroleum exploration related segments.Behaviour of FIIs and other performances of companies will be important for the coming period. As repeatedly I had mentioned related to the Shashak of Finance will be important in coming two years.

Global cues and local indications<span id=""more-22892""></span> are better for the day, only point of concern is combination of Rahu and Ketu. Local politics and regional impact of virus may become cause of concern. Or I can say that coming period will be tough for certain areas in the nation.It's a news driven market, not a concrete growth or business driven market. It is also clear that only few segments have worked in past lockdown period, so results or balance sheet of such segments may remain bit better, possibly cash-flow issues can be cause of concern, because globally cash-flow was badly (severely) affected. We can imagine when crude had faced big choke, which indicates global choke of economy.It is a time when one of the political parties may think that during the crises of this Pandemic – they can regain their base. I feel that it's a time to work concrete, Saturn will give Justice, which is transiting in own house.Time is coming when certain areas may feel shortage of working force and certain areas may have work force, but lack of work. Which may also influence production even after the opening of real-estate work, industrial work, and others. This issue may develop due to political reasons but may give set back to production etc.Balancing of manpower will be key for coming period.Market may have positive indications from global cues but can be tough due to local reasons. I will prefer to deal on the basis of wait and watch. Even then some positive moves can be seen in Airlines, IT, communication, transport, logistics and automobile segment.This can be a day for traders but with care. Chances for long term investors – based on the movements of segments and good companies only. Impact of FIIs is not good currently, so in coming period we may see some buying from FIIs (if we get bit lower levels).Opportunities at lower levels in banking sectors will be better.

For India it will be more important for the religious harmony especially in coming period within the running year.Virus, unemployment, and confused way of lockdown 5.0 or unlock 1.0 may be another point of concern for common man and may delay in restoration of movements of production or purpose of unlocking the 65 days old unlock. I am hopeful that in coming period or by the end of the June 2020, such confusion will be over, and situation will start improving as expected by the government.I agree that lots of work is done for the government, but planetary position indicates that mass of employed citizen has suffered and may be without Job – which may be big cause of concern. Only labour is not the suffering citizen who has or is suffering. Consumption of white goods, all quality of goods will be strong only when lower middle class or middle class will have regular source of income.These are the concern, which may check fast bouncing of share market.

Indications are that Share market with financial institutions and banks are well supported by their own lord, only point of concern is that this Mercury is with Rahu. This may give some impact either on leader of finance of nation or ups and downs at any levels from upper levels.Nifty may further move for advantage and also may give chances of consolidation on upper levels. Foreign cues and situation of FIIs may give advantage to the market, that means situation may give positive opening.Geo-political situation is tricky. This may develop some challenges in coming months. Let us hope for the best. In our nation, we may need some more professional person for Finance, so that nation can avail advantage against adverse condition.Regarding crude oil, situation may again be bit tough for the prices.

Malefic planets and degree wise (chhaya graham) Lunar eclipse will be another event within 24 hours.

(all the retrograde planets are active)Activities in IT, communication, travels-related and logistics can be seen. Important is FIIs movement is giving interesting touch to the local share market.Corona is still not under control and situation may further aggravate in the rural sector (as planets are indicating) of certain areas of nation (possibly, this will be because of mass movement).Government's total focus is for labours who are living their working places, but one another big segment is also discarded by the national approach is – Lower middle class, their salaries are chocked, they are without jobs, many may be in middle age group, they will not be in a position to ask for food or any other type of food grain support from government. Fee burden and other issues + pressure of losing their jobs due to lock down or slow economy cycle since last 2-3 years (debatable).I feel that some movements in small caps and mid-caps can be seen, index may see volatility during the day.Textiles, cotton, alcohol, spirit, sugar, agro-products, agriculture related segments, pesticides, paper, leather, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, chemicals, acids and many more segments may be showing movements.Nifty may try to breach 10000.

Three planets are retrograde apart from Rahu and Ketu.Local and global indications are positive. I feel that Nifty may try to regain some old levels. It will be better to be watchful around Solar eclipse. That means trade for a week or 10 days will be better, long for 20-25 days may not be advisable. This Solar eclipse will be total and in India, categorically in the house of banks and finance and sea/research/crude/insurance related segments.Trade may be positive. It will be better to be watchful at the time of opening. Nifty may show positive movements. It will be better to be watchful after 14:00 Hrs (IST).In such planetary conditions Nifty may show movements of 1.5% or so.Movements in automobile, banks, financial institutions, power, infrastructure, and almost all the segments may be showing movements.

Local market is hopeful for coming improved market movements etc. E-commerce is working strongly because logistics support has improved from this week.Indications are positive for the day. Some changes may be seen after 14:00 Hrs (IST) or so.Movements for another positive opening. Keep an eye on announcement or news from government or agencies in coming period. This includes results of companies.I would like to look for positive trade. Market may look to regain levels of previous day. Even then chances of profit bookings on upper levels possible, but period is not bad for the market.Almost all the segments are active – directly or indirectly due to conjunction etc. So, mid-caps and small-caps may also show movements. Index may also show movements. News related to medicine to Corona – is not far, it may take 3-4 months for outcome or announcement of final results and going for support to public.

Jupiter is playing important role along with Rahu-Ketu axis. This period is not only creating a foundation for long term global political understandings and platform for misunderstandings. Or in simple words new relationships. Same may happen in local political environment also.Corona is also picking due to unlock of lockdown, but real picture is not clear, due to test ratios in the nation. Common man is not getting chance for test and is also afraid due to financial aspects (as media is describing), which is also causing long term impact on the life and market in coming period.Today, market may look for lower bases. Dip is possible, possibly again one dip due to Rahu can be seen. Balancing between market movements and Virus unless some medicine will be in the market.Trade wisely. Look for opportunities at lower levels only in good equities. Keep a watch on results of companies. These results are not based on lockdown, this will reflect slowdown before the lockdown also.

Sudden activities in market<span id=""more-23069""></span> or global events or anywhere will not be surprising. If any one is calculating retrograde position of Rahu and Ketu, then this will be considered as their regular transit pattern, if Rahu and Ketu transits direct during the same period then it is considerable.On Sunday, there will be total solar eclipse, so I will not prefer to carry position (for traders) or like to be watchful. This may influence banks and financial institutions, and chances of face-off may increase.Jobless or unemployment is another point of concern (lower middle class – white coloured). Government is concerned for labours, because they are in the not covered by media or not important for political or TRP purpose but may be much important for giving a consumption flow to quality and good products. Labours can give again a news for Parle-G type of product but for white goods industry, automobile, tyres, FMCG, and many more important industries.Our concern issue is TRP based support (for anyone). This may give short term policies, but for going in depth, we need appropriate person in the ministry of Finance.I believe that in coming period there are chances of profit bookings from upper levels or a downfall from upper levels. So, for short term traders can look for opportunities on the basis of buy on dip. Long term can look for good companies, which can survive under tuff position like Lockdown like IT, communication, FMCG, e-commerce and likewise many more.Automobile is backbone and indicator for growth of economy. Which is not in a comfortable position. This will be proved by the annual performance of 2019-20. Lockdown was for only last 10 days of financial year.Currency may show some betterment than the previous day but still above levels.

We can not ignore impact of Solar eclipse, especially in the house of banks and finance, Kutumb (family), Vaani (statements/speeches) and many more. House of research, insurance, crude, sea and related segments are also influenced with this eclipse.Power, infrastructure, automobile and automobile tyres with ancillary may give some opportunity to earn in coming days.

Day is also having touch of three<span id=""more-23118""></span> retrograde planets. Indications are cues from foreign lands and other issues may remain important. Volatility with positive touch is my take due to combination of Rahu and Ketu.Important is Mahadasha of Mercury of China is giving clear aspect to their bordering area, and for us Mahadasha of Moon is lord of bordering area, so this may be point of concern. For us at least three borders are point of concern, because of Nakshtra position of three planets based in our neighbouring area (India's horoscope).Economically, wait for the results of companies and their real performance for the period of 2019-2020 (only days were for lockdown). E-commerce and IT, many other companies which were capable of doing from home, had worked during the lockdown with proper capacity.Nifty may try to regain bases. Although some ups and downs will not be surprising or sudden rise or sudden movements not surprising. Market after correction is ready for looking for bases.I also believe that economic situations are not comfortable, and consumption will not be as good as it should be due to unemployment of middle and lower middle class.Today, market may remain positive, some upside movement is possible.

Nifty may look for +75 levels or so. Since, Rahu is strongly active today, so suddenness or sharp rise or sharp sudden changes are possible.

Performance of companies for second quarter of this financial year, is again bit tough (consumption wise).Market may show some mix results during the day. Rahu and Ketu may give some volatility (Possibly in the range). Nifty may try to hold levels at the lower levels and look to touch upper levels of 10400 or so. It will be better to keep a watch at the closing levels.Directly seven planets are active, whereas indirectly eight planets are active. So, I can expect movements from many segments. Since, three retrograde planets and total combust Mercury are active. This is quite possible that neither banks nor share market may get any support from its lord. So, chances of some pressure are also possible.Other planets are also active, which may try to give some better moves. Issues for the shasak of Finance Ministry is persisting. Which may be big cause of concern for the proper growth post this Pandemic. Since, last budget (2019 July) market and companies have lost their basic strength or demands. Unemployment issues for middle class and lower middle class are high. According to the PM 'HONEST TAX PAYEES' are in trouble. For government they are not good voters (probably) that's why they are ignored in each step by the government.These ""HONEST TAXPAYERS"" are facing trouble from banks and no support from government. Again, government is not giving any practical support to them. Theses Honest taxpayers are key to give boost or dip in consumption story of white goods and other good products.Anyways, I feel market is not strong for the day, no support from its lord, so chances of volatility and may look for lower levels also.Many segments may remain active.Indian Rupee may trade in between 75.20 to 76.00 per USD.Please like my Facebook page @ <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AnoopAstroSutra"">https://www.facebook.com/AnoopAstroSutra</a>.Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Connecting to %s",rahu sun lead day well support ketu mar saturn rx moon jupit rx spread viru span id span may seen come period may due aggress test etc may first step know realiti relat covid perform compani second quarter financi year bit tough consumpt wise market may show mix result day rahu ketu may give volatil possibl rang nifti may tri hold level lower level look touch upper level better keep watch close level directli seven planet activ wherea indirectli eight planet activ expect movement mani segment sinc three retrograd planet total combust mercuri activ quit possibl neither bank share market may get support lord chanc pressur also possibl planet also activ may tri give better move issu shasak financ ministri persist may big caus concern proper growth post pandem sinc last budget juli market compani lost basic strength demand unemploy issu middl class lower middl class high accord pm honest tax paye troubl govern good voter probabl ignor step govern honest taxpay face troubl bank support govern govern give practic support these honest taxpay key give boost dip consumpt stori white good good product anyway feel market strong day support lord chanc volatil may look lower level also mani segment may remain activ indian rupe may trade per usd pleas like facebook page href http www facebook com anoopastrosutra http www facebook com anoopastrosutra fill detail click icon log connect

Since, internal economic situation and buying capacity of common man (middle class – lower and middle) is not comfortable, because of uncertainty of job, inconsistency in salaries, but since they are ""FORCEBLY HONEST TAX PAYERS"", unable to hide their incomes like giants or others, may not be in a position to go for proper purchases, only necessary purchasing will be seen by them.A big dip or consolidation in coming months will not be surprising.Insurance, banks, financial institutions, leaf-based, carbon black, solvents, chemicals, infrastructure, power, agriculture, sugar, and many more segments may be showing their moves. Small and mid-caps may also remain active.Look for opportunities. Nifty and otherwise market may show positive moves.Indian Rupee may trade in between 74.30 to 75.20 per USD.Please like my Facebook page @ <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AnoopAstroSutra"">https://www.facebook.com/AnoopAstroSutra</a>.Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:Connecting to %s",sun lead day support mar saturn jupit moon ketu rahu seven planet directli activ span id span wherea share market bank lord mercuri indirectli activ feel activ day mani segment high indic volum may better possibl may give posit share market also keep watch index global news better keep close watch border news covid issu rise high close big figur come period nifti bank avail opportun buy dip basi wherea index may show better move market show steadi upward move sinc intern econom situat buy capac common man middl class lower middl comfort uncertainti job inconsist salari sinc forcebl honest tax payer unabl hide incom like giant other may posit go proper purchas necessari purchas seen big dip consolid come month surpris insur bank financi institut leaf base carbon black solvent chemic infrastructur power agricultur sugar mani segment may show move small mid cap may also remain activ look opportun nifti otherwis market may show posit move indian rupe may trade per usd pleas like facebook page href http www facebook com anoopastrosutra http www facebook com anoopastrosutra fill detail click icon log connect

Transit of Lord of lagna is giving strength to own horoscope.

Market may show consolidation on upper levels or some profit bookings.Stop loss important, before going for buying.Market may give further rise of 70-80 points in Nifty, banks and financial institutions may be doing better. It will be better to go for watchful trades for IT and related segments.

Its not a time to go for weak communication companies, mainly because of the policy of government. Possibly, we are again heading for monopolization of one private sector communication organization (is it good for long run or bad … time will say).Agro-products may see some gains, especially due to the announcements from government, it will be better to watch announcements from government or may run on the basis of news only.Companies related rural areas including FMCG, may be showing better run. Reason is cash flow in rural is better than the urban area. Middle class employees (engaged in table jobs or others, helping hands) are facing still tough time. KPOs and other related segments have reduced their such workforce, and similarly, IT or other areas have reduced worked force. They have lost their earnings.
